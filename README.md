The Simple Calculator Website is a user-friendly web application built using React and CSS that allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations. It provides a clean and intuitive interface that enables users to input numbers and perform calculations with ease. 

Doing this project, I have learned React Reducer: the heart of this calculator website's state management lies in the use of React's useReducer hook. The useReducer hook is a powerful alternative to the more common useState hook, especially when managing complex state changes. It is particularly useful when the state transitions depend on the previous state, as is the case with a calculator.

Benefits of React Reducer:
Using useReducer for managing the calculator's state provides several benefits:

Readability: The reducer function centralizes state updates and makes the code more readable and maintainable by separating state logic from the presentation components.

Predictable State Changes: Since reducer functions are pure functions, they produce predictable state changes, reducing the likelihood of bugs.

Easier Debugging: The state transitions are explicitly defined in the reducer function, making it easier to debug and trace changes.

Scalability: As the calculator's complexity grows, managing state with useReducer remains scalable and organized. 

It was great experience creating this project, I hope you enjoy using it.
